# What is DHCP ?
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network settings to devices on a network. Instead of manually configuring each device, DHCP simplifies network management by dynamically allocating IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS settings.

# How does DHCP work ?
When a device (client) connects to a network, it follows a four-step process to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server:

1. DHCPDISCOVER
2. DHCPOFFER
3. DHCPREQUEST
4. DHCPACK

This process ensures efficient IP address allocation and reduces conflicts, making DHCP essential for both small and large networks.
