# What is DNS ?
The **Domain Name System (DNS)** translates website names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to connect. It acts like the internet’s phonebook, allowing users to access websites without memorizing numerical addresses.  

# How does DNS work ?
When you enter a website, your device asks a DNS server to find its IP address. If the answer isn’t cached, the request goes through multiple servers until the correct IP is found. Once resolved, your browser connects to the site.  

# Why is DNS important ?
DNS is essential for internet browsing but can face issues like slow resolution or security threats. Many users rely on public DNS services like Google (`8.8.8.8`) or Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`) for faster and safer connections.
